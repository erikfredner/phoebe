                    <p>
                        Our daughter Phoebe's 27 days were the most important of our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phoebe was born with a complex congenital heart defect. She died shortly after the surgery
                        needed to
                        repair her heart due to unforeseen complications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Phoebe's story is so much more than her illness. Her short life has
                        already helped the lives of many others, and we hope that legacy will grow.

                        Etymologically, "Phoebe" means both
                        "bright" and "shining." We therefore invite you to light a candle in Phoebe's memory.
                        When you do so, we encourage you to share a kind thought with someone you love.
