                    <p>
                        Our daughter Phoebe&apos;s 27 days were the most important of our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phoebe was born with a complex congenital heart defect. Due to unforeseen complications,
                        she died shortly after the surgery needed to repair her heart.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Phoebe&apos;s story is about so much more than her illness. Although her life
                        was much too short, her legacy will be long.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of this writing, donations in Phoebe&apos;s name
                        have already helped
                        at least <b>fourteen</b> other children with congenital heart defects
                        get the surgeries they need.
